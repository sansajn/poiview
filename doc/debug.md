Crash logs are collected by ACRA library and by default saved to `/storage/self/primary/Android/data/com.example.poiview/files/Documents/` directory as `crash_report_TIMESTAMP.txt` files.

> **tip**: we can use *Device Explorer* from *Android Studio* to access POIView directory or *Total Commander* app
