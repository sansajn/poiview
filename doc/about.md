## Full description
POIView was written to show day activities such as cycle logs from GPS trackers or photos from your gallery on a map view.

POIView can scan through you photo gallery and show each photo on a map if it contains GPS tag as a POI. POI can be clicked to see the photo. Current implementaiton looks both internal and SD card storage galleries and can easily handle >50k photos.

POIView can also show cycle logs in GPX file format (such as ones created by Garmin watches) stored in `trip_logs` folder (internal storage).

In the future we plan bring support for hike logs and collect activities into days.
